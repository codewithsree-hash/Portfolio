# Portfolio

Modern single-page portfolio site for Sreedhar Reddy Illuru.

## Quick start

```bash
cd /workspace/Portfolio
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. If you see a 404, confirm the server is started from the
repo root (where `index.html` lives).

## Deploy

- GitHub Pages: keep `index.html` and `404.html` in the repo root so direct links resolve cleanly.
- Any static host: upload `index.html`, `styles.css`, and the `assets/` folder.

## Customize

- Replace `assets/profile-placeholder.svg` with your professional headshot.
- Update the project descriptions in `index.html` to match your real work.
- Adjust the contact email if needed.
